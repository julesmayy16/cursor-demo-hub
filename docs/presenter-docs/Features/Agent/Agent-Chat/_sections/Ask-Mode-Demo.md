## Ask Mode Demo

> Ask Mode lets you explore and understand your codebase without making changes—perfect for onboarding or code reviews.

Ask Mode is especially powerful for **onboarding new team members**. Since Cursor has already indexed your entire codebase, the agent can quickly:

- Explain how the whole codebase is structured
- Clarify how specific parts work
- Answer questions about patterns, conventions, and architecture
- Clear up ambiguities without you having to dig through files manually

Teams using Ask Mode report **significantly reduced onboarding time**—new engineers can get productive faster by having conversations with the codebase rather than reading through it alone.
